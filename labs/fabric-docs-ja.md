# Lab Name
Fabric Docs JA

# Short Description
A project to translate the Fabric documentation into Japanese.

# Scope of Lab
The purpose of this lab is to translate the Fabric documentation into Japanese. We will use this repository to sync with the latest English version of Hyperledger Fabric, starting with version 2.1.

For subsequent releases, any update to source files will be translated in a new release base branch. Issues are used to track what to update in the changed docs.
